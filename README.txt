This project is used to check the hotschedules webpage and text your phone upon finding a dropped shift. This was built using Python and Twilio API. This is solving the lack of alert system on the hotschedules app or webpage. This was my first mini project and first time using Python ever, I learned a ton about different API systems, Python syntax and web scraping.

Features:

Monitor work schedule for available shifts.
Sends SMS notifications when a shift becomes available.
Configurable via .env file.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
python-dotenv
twilio
